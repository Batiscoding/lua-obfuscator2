# How to start?
Just create new file named "Script.lua" at the same folder with start.lua
Then just run the "start.lua"
Then your obfuscated lua code will appear as named "obfuscated.lua


# What does this code do?
This code reads the Script.lua file and replaces the variable names in it with math.randomseed and string.char functions that will randomly generate function names.
Then it saves the ofuske code as "obfuscated.lua".
